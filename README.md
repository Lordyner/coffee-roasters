## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/introduction/) - For animation

### What I learned

I learned how to use framer motion for basic animation. Like animation on scrolling to reveal section bit by bit.
I progressed in estimation. I estimatede 26 hours to do this project. I did it in 29h, but I didn't plan to add animation so without the animation I'm in time.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn framer motion, and add more complex animations. I also want to keep progressing on estimation. I underestimate the 
complexity of the "create your plan" section, because I didn't read at first the requirement in the readme.

### Useful resources

- [React refresher on state](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/41161580#overview) - This helped me refresh my knowledge on React State.
